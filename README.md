... famous last words. This is a thing however.

I need to get back on track with Python so I'm starting with that. Other things might follow later on.

Wish me luck!

## Day 1

Back to basics

## Day 2

Python again, some lambdas

## Day 3

C++, not as cool as Python

## Day 4

C++ again. This language is straight not fun. Ugh.

## Day 5

Python makes complex thinking and iteration much easier.

## Day 6

Another easy Python day.

## Day 7

Starting with the maths problem! Not sure how to optimally solve step 2.

## Day 8

This would have been a nightmare in a non-scripting language.

## Day 9

Back to Rust. Tough to come back but very cool. Not a good prototyping language though.

## Day 10

I tried to do this in Dlang but didn't have time so back to Python today.
