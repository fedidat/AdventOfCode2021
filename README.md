... famous last words. This is a thing however.

I need to get back on track with Python so I'm starting with that. Other things might follow later on.

Wish me luck!

Languages ranked from subjectively best to worst:

- Python is the best prototyping language I've come across, possible the best language period.
- Rust (day 9) is amazing but the learning curve is tough, not something to pick after a year and possibly pretty verbose, but probably the best for a large and well-maintained codebase.
- Java (day 13) will always pretty cool, no-nonsense and practical.
- Coming back to Dlang (day 11), it's not as enjoyable as I remembered.
- C++ (days 3 and 4) is just not fun at all.

### THAT'S IT! SEE YOU IN 2022!!!
