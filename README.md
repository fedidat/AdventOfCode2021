... famous last words. This is a thing however.

I need to get back on track with Python so I'm starting with that. Other things might follow later on.

Wish me luck!

## Day 1

Back to basics

## Day 2

Python again, some lambdas

## Day 3

C++, not as cool as Python

## Day 4

C++ again. This language is straight not fun. Ugh.

## Day 5

Python makes complex thinking and iteration much easier.

## Day 6

Another easy Python day.

## Day 7

Starting with the maths problem! Not sure how to optimally solve step 2.

## Day 8

This would have been a nightmare in a non-scripting language.

## Day 9

Back to Rust. Tough to come back but very cool. Not a good prototyping language though.

## Day 10

I tried to do this in Dlang but didn't have time so back to Python today.

## Day 11

Dlang is not as enjoyable as I remembered. Maybe the pain of picking it up again, but mostly it doesn't feel mature and popular enough.

## Day 12

Back to Python with a cool traversal algorithm. Not very fast though, takes 8s.

## Day 13

Going back for a while with Java 15. Feels similarly easy to handle compared with Python.

## Day 14

A bit of difficulty for once but so far easier than previous years.

## Day 15

Difficulty ramping up, Dijkstra was hard for me to remember and implement correctly with a grid.

## Day 16

This was so tedious! Not sure Python helped this time. I regret not doing this with Java.
## Day 17

Lots of thinking this time.
